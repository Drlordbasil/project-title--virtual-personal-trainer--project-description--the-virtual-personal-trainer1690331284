from typing import Dict, List, Any
There seems to be few issues in your code. Here are the fixes:

1. You are missing import statement for `List` and `Any`. Add the following import statement at the top of your code:
```python
```

2. There are unused methods in the `VirtualPersonalTrainer` class . You can remove the following methods or provide their implementation:

```python
   def generate_personalized_training_program(self) -> None:
        pass

    def track_progress(self) -> None:
        pass

    def show_achievements(self) -> None:
        pass

    def provide_assistance(self) -> None:
        pass

    def offer_premium_features(self) -> None:
        pass

    def offer_in_app_purchases(self) -> None:
        pass

    def collaborate_with_partners(self) -> None:
        pass

    def generate_data_insights(self) -> None:
        pass
```

With these fixes, your code should now be optimized and error-free.
